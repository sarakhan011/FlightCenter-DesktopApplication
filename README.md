# ✈️ Airline Reservation System (Flight Center)

## Project Overview

The **Airline Reservation System** is a desktop-based application developed using **C++ and Qt Framework**. The system allows users to register, log in, search available flights, select seats, make reservations, and manage bookings through an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).

The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, GUI development, file handling, user authentication, and basic reservation management.
